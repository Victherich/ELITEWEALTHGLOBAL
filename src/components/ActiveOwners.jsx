            <Text>
            Our operations as an active minority shareholder require considerable efforts to understand the portfolio companies and their industries. Our investment team assigned to the company in question

carries out an analysis of the company
frequently meets company management, investors, regional representatives and other large shareholders
visits production plants, attends capital market days and industry seminars
studies the companyâ€™s competitors.
<br/><br/>
The in-depth information and views accumulated in this way will be the basis for the investment teamâ€™s value creation plan for the company and for the teamâ€™s efforts to help, through active dialogue, the company outperform its peers.
