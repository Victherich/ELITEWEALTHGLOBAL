        <h2>üåç Visit to the Centre for Waste Management and Sustainable Resources</h2>
        <p>
          Prior to his speech, Mr. Ade Mabo visited the CWMSR, where he was introduced to 
          groundbreaking innovations by FUPRE students who displayed a range of valuable items 
          crafted from waste materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          These included <strong>recycled furniture, fashion accessories, eco-friendly construction 
          materials, and energy-efficient devices</strong>, demonstrating the vast potential in 
          waste-to-wealth initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Commending the students for their ingenuity, Mr. Mabo encouraged them to scale their 
          ideas into sustainable businesses, reinforcing the importance of entrepreneurial thinking 
          in environmental conservation.
